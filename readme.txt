  This is a basic API library for accessing some Sikuli 
  methods to detect objects, wait for them to appear/disappear,
  click on them, etc. using captured "expected" PNG images 
  of the objects in question.
  
  Implemented with reference to http://sikuli.org/doc/java-x/
  
  For use through:
  
    - command line (CLI) interface for stand-alone use, or
      external integration with other tools/frameworks via
      the system shell 
  
    - Robot Framework as a Java library (remote or not)
      http://www.robotframework.org
  
    - Java (XML-RPC) remote server/library interface,
      usable with Robot Framework or as stand-alone 
      automation server
      http://code.google.com/p/jrobotremoteserver/
      
    - integration with other Java code based tools/frameworks via
      integration or calling of this library code from Java
      
  NOTE: Exceptions are caught and passed to standard output and
        method returns false. While this doesn't fit general
        programming design & Robot Framework specification for
        keyword failures, if you don't like it, feel free to remove
        the exception handling and let the exception propagate and
        be handled by the caller, and in the case of the CLI, let
        exception be handled at the main method. It is designed
        this way for simplicity, so one (and novice users)
        don't have to deal with exceptions. False = fail. And in
        the case of this wrapper library, generally if the
        exception happened, you pretty much know why (straightforward).
        
        And one can also modify to add a flag to enable/disable or
        just disable (no flag) dumping of the exception info, 
        as it can be a lot of extraneous text.

  Changes from original source:
  	- SCM has been changed to Git and it is planned to upload
  project to GitHub
   - used sikuli library had been updated to 0.10.2 and code has
   been refactored accordingly 
   - Settle this project as Maven build
  	- TODO unit tests planned and implemented
  	- TODO project has been re-shaped based on project rfdblibrary
  available at https://github.com/ThomasJaspers/robotframework-dblibrary
   - TODO (and the original goal was) implement an escape mechanism
   for sending keystrokes with type_at_object method
   @see type_at_object
  
  To satisfy prescribed maven dependency 'sikuli-script' follow these steps:
  	- download sikuli from sikuli.org
  	- go to folder where sikuli-script.jar is installed
  	- issue the following command there:
  		mvn install:install-file 
  			-Dfile=sikuli-script.jar 
  			-DgroupId=org.sikuli 
  			-DartifactId=sikuli-script 
  			-Dversion=0.10.2 
  			-Dpackaging=jar
